# Multivariate Linear Regression Model for Predicting Miles Per Gallon (MPG)

In this project, a multivariate linear regression model was developed to predict the miles per gallon (MPG) of cars based on various factors. Using the well-known `mtcars` dataset, the model was built to explore the relationships between MPG and key vehicle characteristics such as weight (wt), horsepower (hp) and quarter-mile time (qsec).

The primary objective of the project was to:
- Build a predictive model for MPG using multiple independent variables (weight, horsepower, and quarter-mile time).
- Evaluate the model's accuracy and performance using statistical summaries.
- Visualize the actual vs. predicted values to assess how well the model performs.

## Steps Involved

1. Data Loading and Exploration: Utilized the `mtcars` dataset and inspected the relationships between variables.
2. Building the Linear Regression Mode: Created a regression model to predict MPG based on weight, horsepower, and quarter-mile time.
3. Model Evaluation: Analyzed the model's accuracy using statistical summaries.
4. Prediction: Generated predictions for new data points using the model.
5. Visualization: Plotted actual vs. predicted MPG values to evaluate model performance.

## Key Learnings

- Practical experience in multivariate linear regression modeling in R.
- Enhanced understanding of model performance evaluation using statistical summaries.
- Improved skills in visualizing actual vs. predicted data points.

## Technologies Used

- R Programming
